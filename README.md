This paper introduces a wearable robotic controller for teleoperation, capturing up to seventeen degrees of freedom (DoF) in human arm-hand movements. The system consists of a master side with IMU sensors for arm orientation and potentiometers for finger motion, and a slave side that calculates joint angles. Data is transmitted via RF, with the slave side translating sensor readings into joint angles using a Relative Orientation Vector approach. These joint angles are mapped to a robot arm-hand model, validated through simulations and experiments, showcasing effective remote control of robotic limbs.
